\section{Experience}
\cventry{2019--Present}{Gemini}{}{Exchange Engineer}{}{
	\textit{Gemini is a cryptocurrency exchange with a focus on serving institutional customers. Institutional customers demand high availability, low latency, and the ability to store large amounts of digital assets.}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \underline{Growth Team} - I focussed on unifying Gemini's data aquisition strategy, across teams, products, and platforms. Unifying these tools vastly improved the quality of data available to leadership
		\item \underline{Gemini Pay} - Engineered a backend enables Gemini's 2M+ customers to spend their crypto at several businesses across the country.
		\item \underline{Exchange Team} - Rewriting the matching engine to support lower latency, and higher availability. Develop performance oriented components in a fault tolerant distributed system.
	\end{itemize}

\cventry{2018--Present}{Lockbook.app}{}{Founder}{}{
	\textit{Lockbook is an end to end encrypted document editing and sharing platform.}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item With our focus on quality we create native applications for each platform. To maximize code re-use, I created a "Core" library written in Rust that clients can use via FFI/JNI.
		\item Requires proficiency with C\#, Swift, Kotlin, and Rust.
		\item AES \& RSA cryptography primitives are used for encryption, key sharing, authentication, and signature verification.
		\item All work is fully open source (github.com/lockbook/lockbook). Started as a script to encrypt and decrypt a folder and organically grew as more people began to share the vision of a better place to store thoughts and collaborate with others.
	\end{itemize}
