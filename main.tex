\section{Experience}

\cventry{2015--Present}{SAP SE}{}{Digital Interconnect Group}{}{
	Digital Interconnect is a team that specializes in interacting with Telco infrastructure. Our team builds products that help Telco providers interoperate globally, seamlessly. Leveraging these offerings and relationships, we've developed an array of exciting products that help businesses message their customers (LiveLink 365), perform market research (Consumer Insights 365), and enhance their security (Authentication 365). \\
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {Jan 2018-Present -- \underline{UI Technical Lead} -- My efforts are currently focused around helping teams working on similar problems collaborate and share UI technologies more effectively. I'm excited to be exploring new UI technologies such as Vue.js and React. And how these technologies might relate to our diverse technical stacks and strategies. } \\ 
		\item {May 2015-Dec 2017 -- \underline{Full Stack Intern} -- During my internship, I had the opportunity to contribute to many parts of our product offerings, as well as prototype experimental features. These are some of my favorite contributions:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item CI365 - market research platform
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Created intuitive ways for users to query and visualize unstructured data
						\item Wrote efficient execution strategies for ambitious data science algorithms.
						\item Wrote machine learning algorithms to fill in unavailable attributes in our data.
						\item Created a toolset that is used by CI365 data scientists to visualize our data with high fidelity, to identify areas of undercoverage/overcoverage, as a critical QA step.
					\end{itemize}
				\item Pioneered Code Insights Initiative as a Passion Project
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Developed a tool to monitor code quality in large codebases with multiple contributors.
						\item Converts version-controlled codebases into custom Abstract Syntax Trees which are used to track KPI's for each developer.
					\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}

\cventry{2014--2017}{AutoAI (formerly DriveAI)}{}{\underline{Co-Founder}}{}{
	Co-Founded an initiative to create an Open Source Hardware and Software platform for Autonomous Vehicles. This started as a standalone non-profit organization and is in the process of being converted to a student organization at Rutgers University.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Led technical, administrative and fund-raising efforts. Gained funding from MunichRE Insurance.
		\item The current development vehicle is an electric golf cart. Technical focus is on the application of LIDAR and stereo cameras within a novel sensor fusion algorithm that may substantially reduce the cost of computer vision for self driving cars.
