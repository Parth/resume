\section{Experience}

\cventry{2015--2018}{SAP SE}{}{Software Engineering Intern\hfill May 2015 -- Present}{}{
	My internship with SAP started in my freshman year and flexes with my school schedule (full-time/part-time). My major focus has been on the Consumer Insights 365 (CI365) product -- a big data solution that allows market researchers to gain unique consumer insights by analyzing terabytes of data from telco providers.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item CI365 --  My work on CI365 spanned multiple areas of the technical stack.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Front-end: create intuitive ways for users to query and visualize unstructured data.
			\item Back-end: create code to efficiently execute ambitious data science strategies.
			\item Data Science: Wrote machine learning algorithms to fill in unavailable attributes in our data.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Authored Data Visualization Suite for Massive Geospatial Datasets
			\begin{itemize}
				\item I saw the need and proactively created a toolset that is used by CI365 data scientists to visualize our data with high fidelity, to identify areas of undercoverage/overcoverage, as a critical QA step.
			\end{itemize}
		\item SAP Multi-Factor Authentication Solutions
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Identified an improvement opportunity in SAP's SMS-based two factor authentication product and implemented a TOTP two-factor authentication strategy.
				\item Led exploration of novel multi-factor authentication strategies, that utilized push notifications and biometrics, for future development.
			\end{itemize}
		\item Pioneered Code Insights Initiative as a Passion Project
			\begin{itemize}
				\item  Developed a tool to monitor code quality in large codebases with multiple contributors.
				\item Converts version-controlled codebases into custom Abstract Syntax Trees which are used to track KPI's for each developer.
				\item Pending addition to SAP's collection of Open Source Software.
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

\cventry{2014--2018}{AutoAI (formerly DriveAI)}{}{Co-Founder\hfill Oct 2014 -- Present}{}{
	Co-Founded an initiative to create an Open Source Hardware and Software platform for Autonomous Vehicles. This started as a standalone non-profit organization and is in the process of being converted to a student organization at Rutgers University.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Led technical, administrative and fundraising efforts. Gained funding from MunichRE Insurance.
		\item The current development vehicle is an electric golf cart. Technical focus is on the application of LIDAR and stereo cameras within a novel sensor fusion algorithm that may substantially reduce the cost of computer vision for self driving cars.
	\end{itemize}
